# WordScriptMacro

This an old word macro from the BBC that isn't supported any more, 
I think it is the public domain, as I'm not selling it or making any money. I have
no idea if this works on Windows but it "should".

Eventually I will be updating this for Mac 2011/2016.

It currently works with Office 2011 for Mac, it's a bit klunky but it works and is free so don't bitch
or complain about it.

It has formats for Stage, TV, Film, Radio in US and UK formats.

Feel free to fork.

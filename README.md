# WordScriptMacro

This an old word macro from the BBC that isn't supported any more, 
I think it is the public domain, as I'm not selling it or making any money.

Eventually I will be updating this for Mac 2011/2016.

It currently works with Office 2011 for Mac, it's a bit klunky but it works and is free so don't bitch
or complain about it.

I will eventually update it when I have time.

Feel free to fork.
